# Zombie Detective Guessing Game Alexa Skill
An Amazon Echo app in which Alexa will try to guess which PvZ 2 character you are thinking about.

## Building
The build requires the alexa-skills-kit jar, which is only available to registered Amazon application developers.
Once registered, download the AlexaSkillsKitJava.zip and build it according to the instructions.

That build will add the artifact to your local maven repo.
If you want to keep it locally, you can copy the repo contents from that project into the repo directory in this project.

To create a jar that can be loaded to Lambda, the typical maven command will look like:
```mvn assembly:assembly -DdescriptorId=jar-with-dependencies package```

## To deploy as a Lamba function
- Read the example section [Preparing a Java Sample to Deploy in Lambda](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/deploying-a-sample-skill-to-aws-lambda)

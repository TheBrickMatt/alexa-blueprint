## Ideas

### High
1. Tests!
1. shuffle guesses before starting
1. AttributeType hierarchy (say yes to an attribute will auto-include its parents; no discards siblings)

### Medium
1. Maybe option instead of yes/no
1. Guess when out of attributes, but not ideas

### Low
1. export data to file structure, or database
1. fix project structure for src/main/java and src/test...
